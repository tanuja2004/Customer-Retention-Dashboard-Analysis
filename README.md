Customer Retention Dashboard Analysis
Project Overview:
This project was aimed at developing a dashboard for a telecom company's Retention Manager to analyze customer retention, identify at-risk customers, and propose actionable strategies to minimize churn. The dashboard visualized critical retention metrics and customer demographics, providing self-explanatory insights for decision-makers.

Objective:
To create a customer retention dashboard that reflects KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) related to customer retention and provides actionable insights to improve retention strategies.
________________________________________
Scope:
The project includes the following tasks:
1.	Define KPIs related to customer retention (e.g., churn rate, customer lifetime value, at-risk customer identification).
2.	Create a dashboard to visualize customer demographics and KPIs, making it easy for the Retention Manager and management to understand key trends.
3.	Communicate findings and suggestions via email to the engagement partner, proposing necessary changes based on the analysis.

Data Import and Preparation:
1.	Data Import:
The data was initially provided in Excel format, containing information on customer demographics, contracts, and historical churn behavior.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
o	Handling Missing Values: Checked for any missing data in customer details and churn metrics, which were either imputed or removed as per the relevance.
o	Standardizing Formats: Ensured all categorical fields (e.g., customer segments, demographics) and numerical fields (e.g., customer age, tenure) were formatted correctly.
3.	KPI Definition:
o	Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who have canceled their contracts within a specific period.
o	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Prediction of net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.
o	At-Risk Customers: Identifying customers who are most likely to churn based on past behavior, contract tenure, and usage patterns.

Dashboard Development:
•	Tool Used: Power BI
•	The dashboard was designed to visualize:
o	Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income level, region.
o	Retention KPIs: Churn rate, contract tenure, customer lifetime value, number of at-risk customers.
o	Segmentation: Customer segmentation based on behavior, demographics, and contract type.
Key Visuals:
1.	Churn Rate Visualization:
A line chart displaying the churn rate over time, helping to identify peaks and patterns.
2.	Customer Lifetime Value:
A bar graph showing CLV distribution across different customer segments, aiding in understanding high-value customers.
3.	At-Risk Customers:
A scatter plot mapping at-risk customers based on contract tenure and churn likelihood, allowing for proactive engagement.

Findings and Insights:
•	High Churn in Early Tenure:
Customers who churned were often in their early months of contract. Recommendations included improving onboarding processes to engage customers more effectively during this period.
•	Customer Lifetime Value Insights:
High-value customers had longer contract durations and fewer service complaints. Recommendations were made to improve customer service and loyalty programs.
•	Demographic Patterns:
Younger customers showed a higher churn rate, suggesting targeted retention strategies for this demographic.
________________________________________
Recommendations:
1.	Proactive Engagement for At-Risk Customers:
Develop a system to engage customers before they churn based on their behavior and contract tenure data, rather than reacting post-termination.
2.	Enhanced Onboarding Programs:
Introduce targeted communication and service improvements for customers in their first six months to reduce early churn.
3.	Loyalty Programs for High-Value Customers:
Offer incentives to high-value customers (as indicated by high CLV) to ensure long-term loyalty and retention.

Email Summary:
A concise email was sent to the engagement partner with the findings, explaining the dashboard insights and recommending changes such as proactive customer engagement strategies and enhanced retention efforts for specific demographics.

Tools & Technologies:
•	Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization.
•	Excel: Data import, cleaning, and initial analysis.
•	KPI Definition: Using customer churn, customer lifetime value, and at-risk customer identification.

Conclusion:
The Customer Retention Dashboard Analysis project successfully identified at-risk customers and provided actionable insights for the telecom's Retention Manager. The dashboard enabled data-driven decision-making and provided clear, visualized customer retention trends. Ongoing analysis and monitoring of these KPIs will help in reducing churn and improving overall customer retention.

Future Work:
•	Predictive Modeling: Future iterations could incorporate machine learning models to predict churn likelihood based on customer behavior.
•	Automation: Automating the data update process and generating dynamic reports to provide real-time insights for the retention team.
